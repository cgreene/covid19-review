## Therapeutics

Given the rapid predicted spread of the disease, the development of therapeutics will be critical to mitigating its effect on health and the mortality rate.
Typically, therapeutics can take a few forms.
First, the treatment and reduction of symptoms can result in the reduction of the severity and risk associated with an active infection.
Second, the development of antiviral drugs can drive a reduced recovery time for patients by inhibiting the development of the virus once an individual is infected.
Finally, vaccines present a strategy for bolstering the immune response of the populus broadly to the virus, resulting in a lower rate of infection.
All three of these strategies have been valuable elements of responses to other viruses, including coronaviruses, and are being investigated by researchers at present.
Additionally, there have been suggestions within the scientific community that nutraceutical or dietary supplement interventions may prime an individual‚Äôs immune system to prevent or lessen the impact of RNA virus infections [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007; @doi:10/ggkd3b].
In the following sections, we critically appraise the literature surrounding the repurposing of existing treatments and development of novel therapeutics for the prevention, mitigation, and treatment of coronavirus infections.  

### Treatment of Symptoms

The clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection differs dramatically between individuals.
Some are asymptomatic.
Others experience mild COVID-19 symptoms, such as cough, sore throat and fever, while the most severe cases of COVID-19 include severe complications including pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure and death [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html].
Vaccines are one avenue to mitigate harm from viral pathogens, but in the case of a rapidly growing pandemic the longer timeframe of vaccine development and distribution means that there can be a key for treatments that palliate symptoms to avoid the most severe outcomes from infection.

#### Tocilizumab

A recent study carried out on a sample of 191 adult COVID-19 in-patients at two Wuhan hospitals found that blood samples taken at admission contained significantly higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients who ultimately deceased compared to those who survived; average concentrations of IL-6 remained higher in the deceased group than the surviving group throughout hospitalization [@doi:10/ggnxb3].
This suggests that these individuals may be experiencing a "cytokine storm", which refers to an excessive inflammatory response.
IL-6 plays a key role in this response [@doi:10.1128/mmbr.05015-11].
IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the family of interleukins, which are immune system regulators that are primarily responsible for immune cell differentiation.
Specifically, IL-6 promotes the differentiation of activated B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells [@pmid:9052836] and acts as a growth factor for hybridoma and myeloma cells [@pmid:8431556; @pmid:2104241].
In addition, IL-6 also induces the differentiation of na√Øve CD4+ T cells into effector T-cell subsets [@doi:10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-14-0022].
In this way interleukins regulate both the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.
In this context, the observation of elevated IL-6 in patients who died may reflect an over-production of proinflammatory interleukins.

In a healthy situation the lung respiratory epithelium together with alveolar macrophages limits the activation of the immune system, ensuring homeostasis.
The introduction of the S-protein from SARS-CoV to mouse macrophages was found to increase production of IL-6 and TNF-Œ± [@doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2007.02.007], and deceased SARS-CoV patients were found to have intermediate levels of IL-6, IL-1ùõΩ, and TNF-Œ± expressed in a number of ACE2-expressing cell types sampled from the lung and bronchial tissues during autopsy [@doi:10.1002/path.2067].
However, other reports found the severe respiratory condition ARDS to be associated with elevated concentrations of IL-6 in BALF, but that concentrations of Tumor Necrosis Factor Œ± (TNF-Œ±) and IL-1ùõΩ decreased with the onset of ARDS [@doi:10.1164/ajrccm.164.10.2104013].
These cytokines enhance the pro-inflammatory reaction by increase acute-phase signaling, trafficking of immune cells to the site of primary infection, epithelial cell activation, and secondary cytokine production.
The acute phase response to infection results in the heavily damage of the endotelium of blood vessels, which disrupts the balance between pro and anti-inflammatory response [@doi:10.1164/ajrccm.164.10.2104013].
Thus, the holes generated allow not just for the passage of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes to the site of the infection but also the accumulation of liquids into the lungs, which is the ultimate cause of the death as per Acute Distress Respiratory Syndrome (ADRS) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [@doi:10.1007/s00281-017-0629-x], also caused by the new coronavirus.
Recently Chinese and Italian doctors have found that the the Tocilizumab (actemra, by Roche), a drug commonly used in the rheumatoid arthritis, may palliate the most severe symptoms associated with COVID-19.

##### Anticipated Mechanism

Human IL-6 is a glycoprotein of 26 kDa and it consists of 184 amino acids containing 2 potential N-glycosylation sites and four cysteine residues. IL-6 binds to its receptor either in the insoluble (IL-6R) and soluble (sIL-6R) form.
The receptor specificity determines the type of signaling. Specifically, the binding of IL-6 to the cell membrane receptor IL-6R gives rise to the "classical transduction of the signaling", while to binding to sIL-6R generate the so called "trans-signaling" [@doi:10.1016/j.cytogfr.2012.04.001; @doi:10.1042/bj3000281].
IL-6 signaling occurs through 3 independent pathways: the Janus-activated kinase (JAK)-STAT3 pathway, the Ras/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) pathway and the Phosphoinositol-3 Kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2016.00604].
The ultimate result of the IL-6 cascade is to direct transcriptional activity of various promoters of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TFN, including IL-6 own regulation through the activity of NF-Œ∫B [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2016.00604].
Particularly, IL-6 synthesis is tightly regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally . In this context, it has been shown that viral proteins can enhance transcription of the IL-6 gene, via strengthening the DNA-binding activity between several transciptional factors and IL-6 gene-cis-regulatory elements [@doi:10.2492/inflammregen.33.054].
Tocilizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds both to the insoluble and soluble receptor of IL-6, de facto inhibiting the IL-6 immune cascade.

##### Current Evidence

Chinese doctors have started a trial enrolling 188 patients of which 14 with severe lung disease have shown clear sings of improvements, according to their results [@url:https://www.genengnews.com/virology/coronavirus/genentech-launches-phase-iii-trial-of-actemra-as-coronavirus-treatment/].
Also, The AIFA (the Italian Drug Agency) approved the start of a new trial on March 19 recruiting patients at the initial stage of the infection [@url:https://www.univadis.co.uk/viewarticle/covid-19-italy-launches-an-independent-trial-on-tocilizumab-715741].
Together with these independent trials, Roche, also in collaboration with the FDA, will start a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial early April.
The trial will enroll 330 patients globally, which will be followed for 60 days upon use of the drug via injection to analyse its efficiency/safety (Biopharma-reporter.com).
However, previous studies on RA showed that in patients treated with TCZ the rate of incident infections in clinical practice patients was higher than the one observed during clinical trial [@doi:10.1093/rheumatology/ker223].
Also, RA patients with chronic hepatitis B (HB) infection showed high risk of HB virus reactivation upon TCZ administration in combination with other RA drugs [@doi:10.1111/1756-185X.13010].
These last findings highlight the need to search for a balance between impairing a harmful immune response, such as the one generated by the cytokine storm, and preventing the worsening of the clinical picture of the patients by potential new viral infections.
This aspect is probably crucial to be investigated further in the trials that are about to start.
Perhaps, the TCZ treatment would best suit patients with severely compromised lungs due to the Covid-19 infection and are therefore at greater risk of death, in order to stop the uncontrolled immune response before it‚Äôs too late.

### Small Molecule Drugs for Targeting SARS-CoV-2

The replication cycle of a virus within an epithelial host cell includes 6 basic steps which can be shortly summarised as follow: i) attachment of the virus to the host cell; ii) penetration by endocytosis; iii) uncoating, classically defined as the release of viral contents into the host cell; iv) biosynthesis, during which the viral genetic material enters the nucleus where it gets replicated; v) assembly, where viral proteins are translated and new viral particles are assembled; vi) release, when the new viruses are released into the extracellular environment [@isbn:978-1405136457].
Antiviral drugs do not kill the virus, rather they inhibit its amplification by impairing one of these steps.
Nowadays, many of these drugs act during the biosynthesis step in order to inhibit the virus‚Äô genetic material replication.
Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus.
Differently from a DNA virus, which can use the host enzymes to propagate itself, RNA viruses depends on their own polymerase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in order to be replicated [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7; @doi:10.1002/jmv.25761].

#### Nucleotide Analogs

Why one might use nucleotide analogs.

##### Avigan

Avigan (Flavipiravir, from Toyama chemical Fujifilm) is a drug which has been found effective to block viral amplification in the Influenza virus infection.

###### Anticipated Mechanism

Specifically, Avigan is a nucleoside precursor efficiently recognised as guanosine and adenosine analogue by the virus polymerase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase).
While a single incorporation does not influence RNA transcription, multiple events of incorporation lead to the arrest of RNA synthesis [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068347].
Importantly It was already shown that Avigan is able to give 100% coverage against the Ebola virus in mice [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.02.014].
Furthermore, there are evidences that drug might also work against Corona virus infection.
For instance, a recent study showed its effectiveness compared to other antivirals such as lopinavir and ritonavir [@doi:10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007].
The drug was tested on a sample of 80 patients (35 experimental sample, 45 control group) and increased the speed of recovery (measured as viral clearance from the patient by RT-PCR) of about 4 days, compared to the control sample treated with the other anti-virals, such as Lopinavir and Ritonavir.
Also lung body scan seem to look better in about 91% of the patients analysed [@doi:10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007].
However, the size of the sample is too small to give a powerful statistics, as well as the choice of the patients did not take into consideration important factors such as previous clinical conditions, sex, while there was no age categorisation.

##### Remdesivir

Remdesivir (GS-5734) was developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola.
It does not have any FDA-approved use.
Although a clinical trial in the Democratic Republic of Congo found some evidence of effectiveness against ebola, two antibody preparations were found to be more effective, and Remdesivir was not pursued [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1910993].

###### Anticipated Mechanism

Remdesivir is metabolized to GS-441524, an adenosine analog that inhibits a broad range of polymerases and then evades exonuclease repair causing chain termination [@doi:10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056; @doi:10.1128/mBio.00221-18; @doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].
Although it was developed against Ebola, it also inhibits the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV polymerase and inhibits coronavirus replication in cell culture assays with submicromolar IC50s [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653].
It also inhibits SARS-CoV-2, showing synergy with chloroquine [@doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].

###### Current Evidence

In addition to the previous work showing Remdesivir to be an effective treatment for viral pathogens such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in cultured cells and animal models, a recent study found that administration of Remdesivir to non-human primate models resulted in 100% protection against infection by the Ebola virus.
Remdesivir has also been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human cell line sensitive to the virus [@doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].

The effectiveness of Remdesivir for treating patients with COVID-19 is currently under investigation.
Remdesivir has been used on some COVID-19 patients under compassionate use guidelines [@doi:10.1126/science.abb7243, @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2001191; @doi:10.1101/2020.03.09.20032896].
All were in late stages of COVID-19 infection, and these reports are inconclusive about the drug's efficacy.
Remdesivir recently entered controlled clinical trials, and as of March 2020, there are six clinical trials underway to treat COVID-19 patients at both early and late stages of infection and in combinations with other drugs [@doi: 10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292730; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292899; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705; @url:https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-000936-23/FR; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04252664; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04257656].

###### Summary

Remdesivir is a major drug candidate since it attacks the virus with high potency and known mechanism.
Moreover, one of the most successful therapies for viral diseases is to target the viral replication machinery, which are typically virally encoded polymerases.
Small molecule drugs targeting viral polymerases are the backbones of treatments for other viral diseases including HIV and Herpes.
Note that the HIV and Herpes polymerases are a reverse transcriptase and a DNA polymerase respectively, whereas SARS-CoV-2 encodes an RNA dependent RNA polymerase, so most of the commonly used polymerase inhibitors are not likely to be active against SARS-CoV-2.
In clinical use, polymerase inhibitors show short term benefits for HIV patients but for long term benefits they must be part of combination regimens.
They are typically combined with protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors and even other polymerase inhibitors.

#### Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized the way we treat human diseases.
As a result, they have become one of the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market in recent years [@doi: 10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z].
There are currently 79 FDA approved mAbs on the market including antibodies for viral infections (e.g. Ibalizumab for HIV and Palivizumab for RSV) [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z; @doi:10.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095916].
Although vaccines remain the most important way to treat viral infections, their development process is long and they fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
For that reason, neutralizing antibodies have emerged to address these shortcomings.
Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies commonly target viral surface glycoproteins or host structures, thereby inhibiting viral entry [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2017.02323; @doi:10.1080/21645515.2017.1337614].
This section discusses current efforts in developing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and how expertise gained from previous approaches for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV may benefit antibody development.

#### Interferons

Interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines crucial to activate the first (innate) immune system response against viral infections.
Interferons are classified into three categories based on their receptor specificity: type I, II and III [@doi:10.1128/mmbr.05015-11].
Specifically, IFNs I (IFN-ùõº and ùõΩ) and II (IFN-ùõæ ) induce the expression of antiviral proteins which bring the viral RNA to degradation [@doi:10.1016/j.jcv.2003.11.013].
Among these IFNs, IFN- ùõΩ was already found to strongly inhibit the replication of other corona viruses, such as SARS-Cov, in cell culture, while IFN-ùõº and ùõæ were shown to be less effective in this context [@doi:10.1016/j.jcv.2003.11.013].
There are evidences that patients with higher susceptibility to develop Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) show indeed deficiency of IFN- ùõΩ.
For instance, upon other Corona viruses infection IFN- ùõΩ expression and synthesis is impaired, so that the virus can in fact escape the innate immune response [@doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.024].

On March 18 2020 Synairgen plc has received approval to start a phase II trial for SNG001, an IFN- ùõΩ-1a formulation to be delivered to lungs via inhalation.
SNG001 was already shown to be effective reducing viral load in swine flu in vivo model, as well as it has been shown to be effective in the protection from other Corona virus infection in vitro (Synairgen plc, press release).
